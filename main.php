I wish i had never known you! (April 9, 2015)

I wish I had never known you. I was happy before even when you were not there yet. Unlike now, you make me suffer, I know that you didn't mean to have known me. Me too, I wasn't planning on liking you.

But I have learned something. You should find a person who calls you gorgeous instead of hot, who calls you back when you hang up on, who will lie under the stars and listen to your heartbeat, or will stay awake just to watch you sleep... wait for the right person who kisses your forehead, who wants to show you off to the world when you are in sweats, who holds your hand in front of his friends, who thinks you' re just as attractive without anything on. One who is constantly reminding you of how much he cares and how lucky he is to have YOU... The one who turns to his friends and says, thats him...

We should always have in mind that the ones we like the most are usually the ones whom hurt you the most.

And to whoever you are, I just wished to be liked not because I am stable, or good, or well bred, or agile, or intelligent, but because of who I am and what I can be with you.

Hope it's you whom I can hold hands with while watching the sunset......

honestly, you make this story a worthwhile to read... there still are little differences but, to whoever you are, LOVE makes mutes of those who habitually speak most fluently... a little more, and i'll be giving off my heart...

You never seizes to interests me... Even when you're enjoying and having a good time, you never stop surprising me... Honestly, I have met and talked to many but liked very few, yet no-one has been as sweet as you... I'd stand and wait in the world's longest queue, just for the pleasure of a moment with you..

And as I lie awake in my bed, all sorts of thought run through my head... Like why do I like you as much as I do now, then I realized, it's because you are you.... And to whoever you are, hope you're doing great...

Some friends come and go like a season. Others are arranged in our lives for good reason.

And to whoever you are, while everybody else shake my hand, you hold it.

Hope and Love

Sometimes we end our day thinking and telling ourselves that in our life, many thoughts are born in the course of a moment, an hour, a day. Some are dreams, some visions. Often, we are unable to distinguish between them. To some, they are the same; however, not all dreams are visions. Much energy is lost in fanciful dreams that never bear fruit. But visions are messages from the Great Spirit, each for a different purpose in life. Consequently, one person's vision may not be that of another. To have a vision, one must be prepared to receive it, and when it comes, to accept it. Thus when these inner urges become reality, only then can visions be fulfilled. The spiritual side of life knows everyone's heart and who to trust. How could a vision ever be given to someone to harbor if that person could not be trusted to carry it out?

We may also been asking ourselves, "Have we ever been in love?" Horrible isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up. You build up all these defenses, you build up a whole suit of armor, so that nothing can hurt you, then one stupid person, no different from any other stupid person, wanders into your stupid life...You give them a piece of you and they didn't really asked for it. They did something dumb one day, like kiss you or smile at you, and then your life isn't your own anymore. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so simple a phrase like 'maybe we should be just friends' turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart. It hurts really hurts. Not just in the imagination. Not just in the mind. It's a soul-hurt, a real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart pain. The pain we all hate....

And as we face the sunset, we realized that many people came in and out of our lives, but only few left footprints in our heart...
